# Control Mouse with Hand Gesture

## Description:

The purpose of this project is to control your PC's mouse based on your hand gesture. This allows you to control the mouse (on display) without the mouse (physical). :)

Currently, the mouse is controlled based on index fingertip of one hand. The program can only detects one hand at a time. Multi-hand detection and other functions (mouse click, double click, right click, etc.) will be implemented later on.

More detail of the program will be added later on.

## Requirements:
- Programming Language:
	- Python 3.x
- Packages:
	- OpenCV
	- MediaPipe
- Hardware:
	- Webcam

## Instructions:
1. Place your webcam on the top of the monitor and facing you for best result.
2. Run main.py.
3. A window named 'Hands Gesture Detection' will show up.
4. While controlling the mouse with hand gesture, do not place your hand too close to the webcam. (This will be implemented later on to overcome the issue when hand(s) are too close to the webcam.)
5. To terminate the program, to back to the 'Hands Gesture Detection' window and press ESC.
4. Enjoy~
